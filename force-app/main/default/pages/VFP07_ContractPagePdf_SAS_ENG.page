For the avoidance of doubt, any withholding tax duly and timely paid by Customer shall be paid on account of Service Provider and shall discharge the liability of Customer against the Fee to the extent such tax is paid. Customer will supply to Service Provider evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of Service Provider that Customer has accounted to the relevant tax authority for the amount withheld or deducted and will provide all such reasonable assistance as may be requested by Service Provider in recovering the amount withheld or deducted to the extent it is able to do so.  If Customer, in good faith and after analysis of the applicable law or tax treaty, pays any Fee to Service Provider without required withholding or deduction (or subject to withholding or deduction at a reduced rate) and a subsequent audit identifies that a withholding or deduction should have been made from the Fee (or should have been made at a higher rate), Service Provider shall be liable to bear the cost of any such additional withholding or deduction.
