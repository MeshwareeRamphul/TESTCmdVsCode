For the avoidance of doubt, any withholding tax duly and timely paid by Customer shall be paid on account of Service Provider and shall discharge the liability of Customer against the Fee to the extent such tax is paid. Customer will supply to Service Provider evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of Service Provider that Customer has accounted to the relevant tax authority for the amount withheld or deducted and will provide all such reasonable assistance as may be requested by Service Provider in recovering the amount withheld or deducted to the extent it is able to do so.
